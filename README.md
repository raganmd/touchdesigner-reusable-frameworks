# Reusable Frameworks

Authoring large projects in TouchDeisgner is an interesting proposition. It's often easy to get your first project up off the ground, but by your 10th, or 20th you soon find that there might be an awful lot of repetition in the work that you're doing. In fact, like it or not there's a good chance you loose a lot of time to setting up the same things over and over agian.

It is instead the most essential elements I'd offer to intermeidate TouchDesigner programmers who want to reduce the amount of labor that goes into setting up a project, and instead want to focus on making more impactful art. Configuration and archetecture is an art in itself - there's a style and form to this process, and you dearest reader / developer / artist / wanderer will have to make your own way at some point. Hopefully, this will be a lesson in map making, so that you can make your own.

You are already an object orient programmer if you've been using TouchDesigner. You might not fully undersatand the nature of OPP, or the langauge that goes along with, or even why it matters... but if you've been connecting boxes with little noodle lines, you've been
